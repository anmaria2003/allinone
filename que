Throughout the course, Alex participated in live sessions where he received constructive feedback 
on his voice notes and pitches, allowing him to correct errors and develop a stronger musical 
presence. With each passing session, his confidence grew, and by the end of the course, he felt 
ready to perform in front of any audience. Now, not only is he more self-assured, but he is also 
helping his college mates enhance their music knowledge. 
Beyond his musical ambitions, Alex is an explorer at heart. He loves to travel, discover new places, 
and express his thoughts through blogs. His ultimate goal is to become a renowned music composer,
